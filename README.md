**Are people supposed to actually read this?**

No. For actual inquiries/questions, please visit my website and contact me using the contact information.

**Why are the website colors so ugly?**

I drank the school spirit koolaid and those are my school colours. 

(Seriously though, Stockholm Syndrome. For 9/12 months all I see orange and black. WHY ORANGE AND BLACK?).

**You spelt color/colour wrong.**

I'm a confused Canadian.

**Why did you just link to your resume/github? Boo**

uhm.....to demonstrate efficiency?? (copy/pasting everything on the website takes forever).

The website works on mobile 100% of 80% of the time! What more do you want???????????????

(^Am actually really proud of this so pls minimize your browsers. Also send me an email if anything breaks or isn't cool.)

I did have a whole plan of how I was going to display the info and was going to dedicate a bit of the website to fun facts, and hobbies though. Since I obviously didn't do that, here they are:

Fun Facts: I do frisbee, I write mediocre poetry (https://irrelevantfire.com/), and I pinkie promise I'll wake up for early Sunday yoga in the fall.

**You aren't usually this not funny**

^see 10-12hr of working with web development/CSS. I also don't usually talk to myself in Q&A style.

**Also reBlog?**

It's existence is to justify wasting time on the internet reading tech articles (yes, I have lame hobbies).

**Should there be that many magic numbers/values in your CSS code?**

Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the CSS code was tempered with.

**This website looks like every other tech website**

<Insert something about how design trends are elliptical and follow the cycle of the moom, and the seasons of Mars>
